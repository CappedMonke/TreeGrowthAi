# TreeGrowthAi
 
Untrained tree-growth simulation controlled by reinforcement learning.
Used for this were Unreal Engine 5 and its plugin Learning Agents.

To see what it does, open the project with Unreal Engine (5.3.2) and hit the play in editor button.
We hadn't time to fully train the network, so the estimated time to grow an acceptable tree were around 4 hours for us.

In the World Outliner you can find the Tree Agent and Learning Manager Actor.
The Tree Agent sets the rules for the tree.
The Manager sets properties for the learning aspect.
